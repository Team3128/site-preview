-->

<!--1. **Stop by the workshop!** For new members who would like to join in the Fall, you can [contact us](/contact/) or stop by our workshop and talk to one of our [student leaders](/about/leaders/). We'll introduce you to our five departments (Mechanical, Controls, Business, Marketing, and Strategy), and the department heads will be able to get you started with classes and projects.
-->

<!-- 1. **Sign up on our [team roster](https://team3128.us17.list-manage.com/subscribe?u=7c13b1f47db9b4f3392eda9f2&id=b93cada25a).** This will get you added to our mailing list so you know everything that is going on.  Please use an email you check regularly.
2. **Review the [Team 3128 Handbook](/resources/Team3128Handbook.pdf).** The handbook contains information on the basics of what our team does, the code of conduct, team information for parents, build season, etc. You will also need both you and your parent to sign the "Code of Conduct Agreement" page, located on the second page of the same document as the Parental Consent & Waiver (see Step 5).
<!--4. **Turn in a [Safety Waiver](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1hleaX1rEWXA9QjJedI54hGureuK_zdqZQUVaP21OPQM/edit?usp=sharing).** You and your parental unit will need to read, understand, agree to, and sign the safety waiver. Please turn in the physical waiver to a mentor at the workshop.
-->
<!-- 3. **Complete [Team 3128 Safety Training](/members/safety/).** Because of the nature of what we do, safety is paramount to our team. That's why we require all members to complete safety training and take the safety quiz. -->
<!--
That's why we require all returning members to complete safety training by **September 7th, 2020** and all new members to complete it by **October 9th, 2020.**
-->
<!-- 4. **Sign up on [STIMS](https://my.firstinspires.org/Dashboard/), our league information manager, by January 9, 2021.** This will let you attend tournaments and be involved in official robotics events off-campus. *This step requires a parental unit to finish.* You can find detailed instructions for [new members here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B4NhnLtlTNV6T1ljM0o2Wm9wc28/view) and [returning members here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B4NhnLtlTNV6WGR2Rzk5NXpNbzQ/view). 
<!-- The Consent and Release Form, which must be signed to complete STIMS, has changed this year due to COVID-19! Please make sure to read the form carefully, **and have your parental unit read it carefully too.** -->
<!-- As a new requirement this year, **all youth team members must register** in order to participate in any remote or in-person FIRST activities.
5. **Turn in the [Parental Consent & Waiver for 2020-2021](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1UjWkqNu8Vob1p9chxhx3HSveeSVW7P9wvv6B3R-iq3k/edit#heading=h.5fghb1f5uj25).** You and your parental unit must read, understand, agree to, and sign the waiver.

<!--
*CCA has a "**[Health & Safety Agreement](https://drive.google.com/file/d/10I9Qjs45YUul7zUiLoQeGjVue881V42e/view?usp=sharing)**" that your parental unit will eventually need to sign and submit as a scanned document. As part of the agreement, you must also review [SDUHSD Reopening Information](https://www.sduhsd.net/Departments/Administrative-Services/Health-Services/Covid-19-Resources/index.html). However, because reopening procedures are subject to change, we are not requiring it at this point in time. Additional steps may have to be followed depending on how reopening proceeds.*

<!-- That's it! If you have any questions, feel free to reach out and contact our [coaches and leaders](/contact/).   -->

<!--After that, the only thing left to do is to show up! You can also check out our [calendar](/members/calendar/) and [blog updates](/blog/) to find out about all the things happening in robotics. You can also [email our leaders](/contact/) to ask any questions you may have.
-->

<!-- <h2><a id="reopening"></a>Robotics Reopening Plan</h2>
### Starting Nov. 2020 
Some extracurriculars are allowed to reopen on the CCA campus starting November 2020.  This includes Robotics, meaning that you can come to the Robotics Workshop on the CCA campus (even if you are still in Distance Learning for school).  This is completely optional, and you can be a full member of Team 3128 even if you choose not to come to the Workshop in person.

There are a lot of rules and regulations governing this but if you are interested, please talk to your Department Coordinator.  Find out your department’s plans for meeting (when, where) and what “Pods” they are putting together.

In order to be eligible to join a "Pod", you MUST do the following:
1. **Complete all 5 steps** in the "Join the Team" above to ensure that you are a registered member.
2. Thoroughly **review the [Team 3128 COVID-19 Safety Plan](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1PRAlTzHP6b_xbyuxtk17hr1yf7hKAUMhhJHPmvpazGE/edit#heading=h.vbh6w0mxqbwc).**
3. **Read the CCA [“Health & Safety Agreement”](https://drive.google.com/file/d/10I9Qjs45YUul7zUiLoQeGjVue881V42e/view?usp=sharing)** with a parental unit. Have your parental unit sign the document, then scan (or take a picture of) the signed document and upload to [this form](https://forms.gle/dXTjEs13Cevjfvwe9).
    * As part of the agreement, you must also review [SDUHSD Reopening Information](https://www.sduhsd.net/Departments/Administrative-Services/Health-Services/Covid-19-Resources/index.html).
    * Additional steps may have to be followed depending on how reopening proceeds.
4. If you are in the Mechanical Department, pass the **“Mech & Construction Safety Quiz.”** If you are in the Controls Department, pass the **“Controls & Electrical Safety Quiz.”** Go to the [Safety page](/members/safety) to find the links to these quizzes.  
  
Once all signed documents have been received, you may join a Pod (see your Department Coordinator for available Pods) and begin in-person training.

Procedures for entering the workshop, social distancing, sanitizing, etc. are all outlined in the team’s  [“COVID Safety Plan.”](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1PRAlTzHP6b_xbyuxtk17hr1yf7hKAUMhhJHPmvpazGE/edit#heading=h.vbh6w0mxqbwc)

Currently, workshop time priority is given to the Mechanical and Controls departments because they require access to machine tools and the robot.  -->
<p><strong>Acceptance criteria for Team 3128:</strong>  Willingness to learn, enthusiasm, ability to communicate and remain calm under pressure, and the time available to meet the commitments of the Robotics competition season are the primary criteria we will use to rank applicants. Prior robotics experience is certainly helpful, but not required.
Each <a href="/about/departments/">department</a> has a certain number of available spots, and applicants will be given these spots (based on their ranking) until the department slate is full.<br /></p>

<p>If you have any questions, feel free to contact our <a href="/about/leaders/">student leaders</a> for more information! Also, don’t forget to follow us on <a href="https://www.instagram.com/stories/3128aluminarwhals/?hl=en">Instagram</a>, <a href="https://www.facebook.com/aluminumnarwhals">Facebook</a>, and <a href="https://twitter.com/FRCTeam3128">Twitter</a>! <br /></p>

<!-- ### Finding the Workshop
Our Workshop is located right under the Learning Commons. [You can see where our workshop is on this map](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1eCF6W_rqSJrtXeeTQKeTbEUN7-NlHxFs/view?usp=sharing). There are two ways to get to our workshop:
1. **From the school.** Take the stairs between the B building and the Learning Commons towards the Admin Parking Lot. Our workshop is just past the Nest on the right side of the gate (the fenced-in area).
2. **From the Admin Parking Lot** Our workshop can be accessed by entering the large concrete sidewalk just right of the Administration building. It is the fenced-in area. -->

<h2 id="growing-your-skills">Growing Your Skills</h2>

<p>After you’ve signed up, there are lots of different ways to grow your skills:</p>

<p><img src="/assets/page_photos/members/11.jpg" class="leftimage" /></p>

<p><strong>Learn your way around the workshop.</strong> Through various talks and hands-on explanations, mentors and students explain how to use various tools and the various procedures of the team. <br />
<strong>Attend Workshops and Classes.</strong> Throughout preseason, our members and mentors will be giving lessons and working with new members to help them learn more and be ready for build season. <br />
<strong>Be Involved.</strong> Often, the best learning experience comes with jumping right into it. With the guidance of more experienced mentors and members, pursue projects and participate in what interests you.<br />
<strong>Take a look at our team resources.</strong> Our team has collected information that we think is important, and you can find all of that on <a href="/resources/">our resources page</a>.<br /></p>
